Difference between GAN, CGAN, Stable Diffusion:
    GAN:
        Consists of generator & discriminator, generates fake images from random noise, discriminator tries to distinguish real from fake
        Trained simulatenously in a min-max game
        GAN training can be unstable, achieving good results often requires careful hyperparameter tuning
        Results in mode collapse (only generates 1s)

    CGAN:
        Extends concept of GANs by introducing conditional information to generator & discriminator
        CGAN take conditional information as input (e.g. class labels) in addition to random noise
        Allows for more control over the generated samples

    Stable Diffusion:
        Generative model that leverages the concept of diffusion processes to generate images
        Noise is gradually added to a starting image to create a sequence of intermediate noisy images
        By slowly reducing the noise level, the model learns to generate realistic images from the noisy intermediate images
        Requires storing intermediate noisy images during training - computationally expensive
